Hey, I am Qiao Yu (Michelle Yu). 

I considered myself as a hybrid between a data scientist specifically into the data mining and statistical experiments domain (i.e. machine learning models, data visualization, A/B testing), and a data engineer (with Spark, Hadoop, Airflow, Prefect, terraform ect.) on cloud platforms in general. 

I worked on [Cenports Commerce Inc.](https://www.cenports.com/), lead and established the products' sales management model project, formulated products' prices and promotion strategies. During the three years in Cenports, I helped the company achieve an average revenue of 150% and expanded the data team from 0 to 4 persons. In the last year, my skill tree has expanded from machine learning, deep learning to data development and cloud data platform solutions' optimization, along with the certification of [AWS Certified Solutions Architect-Assistant Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/7195a329-68bc-4f6c-8cc6-6fa95db40224/linked_in_profile). 

I studied MS in Statistics (with a focus on Biostatistics) at [University of Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida) and BS in Oral Medicine at [Jinan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinan_University).
