# Bitcoin Trading Prediction Packages
Predicting the price variations of bitcoin, a virtual cryptographic currency. These predictions could be used as the foundation of a bitcoin trading strategy. To make these predictions, I implemented the Bayesian Regression model to predict the future price variation of bitcoin as described in the reference paper. 
The main parts of the package to focus on are the optimization of Sample Entropy and the prediction of price.
**The package develops both R and Python version**. [**CODE**](https://github.com/teenbress/Bitcoin-Price-Prediction_Package/tree/master)

# Logics of the BitBay Packages 
1. Compute the price variations (Δp1, Δp2, and Δp3) for train2 using train1 as input to the Bayesian Regression equation. Make sure to use the similarity metric in place of the Euclidean distance in Bayesian Regression.

2. Compute the linear regression parameters (w0, w1, w2, w3) by finding the best linear fit. Here you will need to use the ols function of statsmodels.formula.api. Your model should be fit using Δp1, Δp2, and Δp3 as the covariates. 

3. Use the linear regression model computed in Step 2 and Bayesian Regression estimates, to predict the price variations for the test dataset. Bayesian Regression estimates for test dataset are computed in the same way as they are computed for train2 dataset – using train1 as an input.

4. Once the price variations are predicted, compute the errors, predicting accuracy, profit and  sell/buy price. Visualize the result with the result_plots function.

# Afterword
      
Applying a Bayesian regression model to predict Bitcoin trend was an interesting attempt in my statistical journey, especially in 2017 when people around me didn't even know what Bitcoin was. As a result, I named the package as BitBay, the bay of bitcoin which generated by Bayestian hahaha. **However, the whole model was trained with the price data in 2016 and 2017, please don't apply the R/python package to predict the Bitcoin price in 2024.**.  

This is the first time I realized the power of statistical modeling and programming.  In 2024, when I look back on this project, I see some shortcomings: for instance, the training data size should be larger, the deep learning models have not yet been developed since only three weeks were available, but **it is like a tiny torch that illuminates my future AI road**.
