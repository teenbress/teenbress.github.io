## About building up a blog
I compared the differences between Jekyll, hexo and hugo, and this blog is set up with Jekyll. You can also build your own blog with GitHub Pages by following the instructions below:

Qiubaiying's introduction: [https://github.com/qiubaiying/qiubaiying.github.io/wiki]    

I am actively seek a job as a Data Scientist or Data Engineer.    
My next step is to accumulate skills and go further in solving business problems with high quality data solutions, including but not limited to data mining and data devops. 
   
About my personal hobbies.    
In the past, I thought that mathematics and medicine were the thing I was most willing to spend my time on in my life, but ChatGPT completely changed my mind. In the past two years, I feel that the most suitable thing for me may not be mathematics, but the product of mathematics-computer. I hope that on this new path, I can find my own way out and realize real value.
